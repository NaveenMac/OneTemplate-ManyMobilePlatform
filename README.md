# OneTemplate-ManyMobilePlatform

This projects aims to explore knowledge that how to seperate view and view logic to web template and seperate bussiness logic and networking calls to network layer.

In this project we are keeping a master zip file inside the project directory  and when project runs this master zip is unzipped and stored in application sandbox.

When server/firebase notify for any template version changes, we update only the sub templates inside the master template directory.

If you face any difficulty to implement this, you can freely ask your issues here.
